    <h1>Mushroom Scampi</h1>

    <h2 class="desc">description</h2>
    <p>While most scampi recipes feature shrimp rather than the namesake small, lobster-like crustaceans, this mushroom version is a joyful meat-free alternative. All of the signatures are here – garlic, butter and white wine – and the mushrooms add a rich, earthy umami element. There is room to vary your mushrooms; while cremini or button mushrooms are great because they remain juicy and plump, oyster or shiitake mushrooms would add a pleasing, chewier texture. This dish is also parsley heavy; some is cooked with the mushrooms and the rest is added fresh, delivering a clean herbaceousness that brightens the dish. Eat with pasta, noodles or bread.</p>
    <h2 class="ingred">ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 shallot, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds cremini or button mushrooms, halved, quartered if large</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable stock or water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red-pepper flakes, or more to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup parsley leaves (tightly packed), roughly chopped</li>
        <li>3 to 4 tablespoons lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons)</li>
        <li>Pasta, noodles or crusty bread, to serve </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="steps">steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large 12-inch skillet over medium. Melt the butter and oil, then add the shallot, stirring until softened slightly, about 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are soft but still plump, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and toss until fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the wine, vegetable stock, salt, red-pepper flakes, a few pinches of black pepper and half the parsley. Increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the wine has reduced by half and thickened slightly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice. Taste and season with salt, if desired.</li>
        <li>To serve, top with remaining parsley and eat with pasta, noodles or crusty bread.</li>
    </ol>
